# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction System

A Machine Learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using real-world health data. This project uses a custom dataset and applies **Logistic Regression** to deliver accurate and interpretable results.

## 💡 Overview

The system takes in multiple medical features such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and lifestyle indicators to predict whether a person is diabetic. The model is trained using **Logistic Regression**, and includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and result visualization.

## 📌 Key Features

* ✅ Custom dataset with realistic medical records
* 🤖 ML model built with Logistic Regression
* 📊 Data preprocessing and missing value handling
* 📈 Accuracy score, classification report, and visualizations
* 🔬 Helpful for early diabetes risk assessment

## 📁 Dataset Info

The dataset used in this project is located in the repository as `diabetes.csv`. It includes the following features:

### 🧾 Input Features:

* Age
* Gender
* Polyuria
* Polydipsia
* Sudden Weight Loss
* Weakness
* Polyphagia
* Genital Thrush
* Visual Blurring
* Itching
* Irritability
* Delayed Healing
* Partial Paresis
* Muscle Stiffness
* Alopecia
* Obesity

### 🎯 Target:

* **Class**: Indicates if the person is diabetic or not (`Positive` / `Negative`)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* **Model**: Logistic Regression
* **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
